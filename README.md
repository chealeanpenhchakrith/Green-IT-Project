## 🔧 Getting Started

If you’re contributing to this project, follow these steps to get started locally.

---

### 🪝 Step 1 – Fork the Repository

Head over to the original repo and click **"Fork"** (top right):

👉 [https://github.com/chealeanpenhchakrith/Green-IT-Project](https://github.com/chealeanpenhchakrith/Green-IT-Project)

---

### 💻 Step 2 – Clone Your Fork

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Green-IT-Project.git
cd Green-IT-Project
```

## ⚠️ Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username ⚠️

---

### 🔌 Step 3 – Set Upstream to Sync with the Original Repo

Your fork won’t automatically receive updates from the original project. To keep your fork up to date:

Add the original repo as an upstream remote (only once):

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/chealeanpenhchakrith/Green-IT-Project.git
```

🔍 Verify your remotes (optional):

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see something like :

```bash
origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Green-IT-Project.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/chealeanpenhchakrith/Green-IT-Project.git (fetch)
```

📥 Sync your fork with the latest changes from upstream :

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```

✅ Now your local fork is up to date with the original repository!
